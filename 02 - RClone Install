# N < For New remote 
# gdrive < for the name
# 8 < For Google Drive (double check the number select incase)
# Enter Your Google ID
# Enter Your Goole Secret
# N < for headless machine #### NOTE: if your on a VM or the actual machine with an interface (GUI), select Y.  
# Enter Your Verification Code
#   Note: If you copy and paste by SELECTING and CLICK the RIGHT Mouse button, it will work; but then you will see it repeat
#   Note: Hold the DEL button to del the extra crap and then paste into a browser to get the verfication code
# N < Configure this as a team drive?
# Y < If asking all is ok?
# Q < to quit

### And if you want to use an encrypted folder instead, do as follows:-
# N < For New remote

# /mnt/plexdrive5/zilch < Use this if not using plexdrive4
# Enter 2 for Standard encryption
# Y) Yes type in my own password
# Enter the password: (choose a good secure one and remember it if you haven't setup a crypt drive before)
# Y) Yes type in my own password (for SALT)
# Enter the password: (choose a good secure one and remember it if you haven't setup a crypt drive before)
# Should now see this below:-
# [crypt]
# remote = /mnt/plexdrive4/zilch   (or /mnt/plexdrive5/zilch)
# filename_encryption = standard
# password = *** ENCRYPTED ***
# password2 = *** ENCRYPTED ***

################# Final Notes ################# START
### Test by following the line below
cd /mnt/rclone && dir
# Something should come up - make sure you have something in your google drive to see/test it.
# If using encrypted version then make sure plexdrive4 or plexdrive5 has already been run.
# If you have something in your google drive and either shows up blanks, it's because your configs were wrong or startup script is wrong
# I RECOMMEND **** that you REBOOT and run the same CMD again to make sure your folders come up!
sudo reboot
