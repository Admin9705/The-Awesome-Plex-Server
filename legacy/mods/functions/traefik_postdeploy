NOTE 1: Standing by for [$tempseconds] + 5 seconds per the set DNS delay
check!

NOTE 2: If using GoDaddy; if there is a txt file there prior to deployment,
this may fail. You may have to remove it and then deploy again!

PG started in late 2016. Frusted by 76TB of 2TB HD's, there had to be a way to
push data to the cloud! It all started from a google document known as
plexguide! We want to be NOOB friendly as possible; linux is frustrating!

Standby! Enjoy the work? Please donate via plexguide.com/donate
